👋 Hi, I’m Niyati — a software developer who loves turning complex problems into clean, efficient code.

💼 8+ years of experience building scalable business applications with Java, JavaScript, and TypeScript — currently solving ERP challenges at Oracle on the NetSuite platform.

🧠 Strong in algorithms, system design, and writing code that actually makes sense (even after 6 months).

🛠️ Currently brushing up my GitHub with new projects — stay tuned!

💬 Outside of code? I write, speak at Toastmasters, and get nerdy about books, self-growth, and coffee ☕.
